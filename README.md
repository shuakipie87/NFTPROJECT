## 🚩 Challenge 1: NonFungibleToken

🎫 Deploy your own NFT contract to learn the basics of the Flow blockchain and Cadence. You'll use:
- The local Flow emulator to deploy smart contracts. 
- The local Flow dev wallet to log into test accounts.
- A template Next.js app with sample scripts and transactions to interact with your contract.

🌟 The final deliverable is a DApp that lets users create an empty collection, mint some pre-loaded NFTs, and transfer them to another account on Flow testnet.
